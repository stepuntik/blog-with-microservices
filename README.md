# Blog with Microservices

The Blog with Microservices project is a modern blogging platform built using microservices architecture. This repository contains the complete source code for the Blog with Microservices application, providing a scalable and modular solution for managing and publishing blog posts.

## Features

- **Microservices Architecture**: The application is divided into microservices, each responsible for specific functions like user authentication, post management, and comment handling.

- **User Authentication**: Secure user authentication and account management for bloggers and readers.

- **Blog Post Creation**: Create, edit, and publish blog posts with rich text editing and multimedia support.

- **Comments and Interactions**: Enable readers to comment on blog posts and engage with authors and other readers.

- **Scalability**: The microservices architecture allows for easy scaling of individual services as the platform grows.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine using `git clone`.

2. **Install Dependencies**: Navigate to the project directory and install the required dependencies for each microservice.

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**: Configure environment variables for each microservice, including database connections, authentication secrets, and service ports.

4. **Start Microservices**: Launch each microservice individually or use containerization tools like Docker to simplify the setup.

5. **Explore and Contribute**: Begin exploring the application, creating blog posts, and interacting with other users. If you're interested in contributing, feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

## Project Structure

The project structure follows a microservices-based approach. Key directories and files include:

- `services/`: Individual microservices, each with its own functionality and dependencies.
  - `auth/`: User authentication microservice.
  - `posts/`: Blog post management microservice.
  - `comments/`: Comment handling microservice.
  - `...` (Additional microservices)
- `client/`: Front-end application for users to interact with the microservices.
- `common/`: Shared code and utilities used across microservices.
- `docker-compose.yaml`: Configuration file for Docker Compose to set up the entire application.

## Dependencies

The Blog with Microservices application relies on various dependencies, including:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/): A web application framework for Node.js.
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/): A NoSQL database for data storage.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
